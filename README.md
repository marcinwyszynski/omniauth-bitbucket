# OmniAuth Bitbucket

This is the OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). 
To use it, you'll need to signup and create a new application or use your 
existing OAuth consumer and secret keys.

This repository was originally forked from [sishen/omniauth-bitbucket](https://github.com/sishen/omniauth-bitbucket). Currently it contains also changes from [codeship/omniauth-bitbucket](https://github.com/codeship/omniauth-bitbucket) since the original repository is no longer maintained.

## Install

Add dependency to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'omniauth-bitbucket'
```

Or install manually:

```
gem install omniauth-bitbucket
```

## Basic Usage

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :bitbucket, ENV['BITBUCKET_KEY'], ENV['BITBUCKET_SECRET']
end
```

If using Rails, add an initializer `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :bitbucket, 'BITBUCKET_KEY', 'BITBUCKET_SECRET'
end
```
